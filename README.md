# Felpsbot /backend

Welcome to the backend submodule of my Felpsbot project.

## Overview

In this part of the project, I use the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web framework for building APIs, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database, and [Redis](https://redis.io/) for caching. For pubsub, I utilize [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). And for object-relational mapping, I rely on [Prisma](https://prisma-client-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Note

This backend is a part of a personal project and is tailored to my specific needs and setup. It's not primarily designed for external use, but you're welcome to explore the code and use it as a reference for your projects.

## Contributing

Although this is a personal project, I'm open to pull requests. If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to contribute.
